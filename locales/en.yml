            You may be asked to enter root password in the next step
            to create network interface. This limitation will be
            lifted once Xhyve binary and helper tool is code-signed.

    commands:
      common:
        vm_already_running: |-
          Xhyve instance is already running.

    errors:
      vmnet_not_available: |-
        Vagrant-Xhyve could not resolve MAC address from Vmnet.framework.
        This may be due to lack of permission or there is already a Xhyve
        instance running for this VM.

      xhyve_booted_without_ip_address: |-
        Xhyve was successfully booted, but Vagrant-Xhyve could not obtain
        its network information. This may due to vmnet driver not being
        loaded or a bug in Vagrant-Xhyve.

      xhyve_not_detected: |-
        Xhyve could not be detected on this machine. You can install Xhyve
        using Homebrew with `brew install xhyve` or follow instructions in
        https://github.com/mist64/xhyve. If Xhyve is already installed,
        make sure `xhyve` binary is in $PATH.

    states:
      short_not_created: |-
        not created
      long_not_created: |-
        The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
        create the environment.

    warnings:
      unclean_shutdown: |-
        The VM doesn't appeared to be cleanly stopped the last time.
        This may due to a reboot or Xhyve unexpectedly stopped.
        Use `vagrant halt` or `vagrant destroy` to stop the VM cleanly.
