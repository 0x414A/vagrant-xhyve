        Xhyve could not be detected on this machine. You can install Xhyve
        using Homebrew with `brew install xhyve` or follow instructions in
        https://github.com/mist64/xhyve. If Xhyve is already installed,
        make sure `xhyve` binary is in $PATH.

    warnings:
      unclean_shutdown: |-
        The VM doesn't appeared to be cleanly stopped the last time.
        This may due to a reboot or Xhyve unexpectedly stopped.
        Use `vagrant halt` or `vagrant destroy` to stop the VM cleanly.
