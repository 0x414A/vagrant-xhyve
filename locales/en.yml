            In order to create network interface, you may be asked
            to enter root password in the next step. This limitation
            will be lifted once Xhyve binary is code-signed.

    errors:
      xhyve_not_detected: |-
        Xhyve could not be detected on this machine. You can install Xhyve
        using Homebrew with `brew install xhyve` or follow instructions in
        https://github.com/mist64/xhyve. If Xhyve is already installed,
        make sure `xhyve` binary is in $PATH.

      long_not_created: |-
        The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
        create the environment.

    warnings:
      unclean_shutdown: |-
        The VM doesn't appeared to be cleanly stopped the last time.
        This may due to a reboot or Xhyve unexpectedly stopped.
        Use `vagrant halt` or `vagrant destroy` to stop the VM cleanly.
