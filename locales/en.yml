    errors:
      vmnet_not_available: |-
        Vagrant-Xhyve could not resolve MAC address from Vmnet.framework.
        This may be due to lack of permission or there is already a Xhyve
        instance running for this VM.

      xhyve_booted_without_ip_address: |-
        Xhyve was successfully booted, but Vagrant-Xhyve could not obtain
        its network information. This may due to vmnet driver not being
        loaded or a bug in Vagrant-Xhyve.

      xhyve_not_detected: |-

        https://github.com/mist64/xhyve. If Xhyve is already installed,
        make sure `xhyve` binary is in $PATH.
